# REJARS_BoilerPlate

Yes, another boiler plate. Mostly used by me on my projects but you're welcome to use it on yours.
This boiler plate will leave your repo with a ready-to-use version of webpack, Redux, React, Redux Toolkit(RTK), Less preprocessor, Terser and the associated VS Code task to use it.

# How to run
1. Clone the repo
1. run `npm install` in the folder where you cloned
1. run `npm run build` to get dev configuration (no minified code, source maps available)
1. run `npm run release` for production code (minified code, no source maps)
1. Go to your "dist" folder and open index.html
